This project was very challenging for me. I tried my best to utlize flex box to make my layout appear similar to the example we were given. 
Things I am most proud about:
My background matching the background of my header. 
I used media queries to make my left navigation row dissappear once screen gets. 
All of my buttons and links work as expected. 


Things I plan to work on in the future: 
making the main boxes different sizes.
